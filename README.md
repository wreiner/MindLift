# MindLift


A mental health app for Android that provides the means for users to add, categorize and later
retrieve their own coping strategies for feeling better when they are down. The possibility for
users to customize their own strategies – as opposed to using pre-made suggestions by the app
provider – is the unique selling point of the app.
